My name is Rob Stryker, and I am a neighbor and volunteer with the Wake County Democrat party, 
working with our precinct ${PRECINCT}. We appreciate your home being a strong Democratic voting household, 
and the Wake County Democratic Party, and Precinct 04-06, would like to thank all of you who are
registered to vote at this address. <br/><br/>

Our main goal for the next 2 months is to find enough volunteers to <b>help us reach every 
Democrat in the precinct.</b> There is tremendous energy in today's electorate, and 
we know that many Democrats would like to get involved, if only they knew where to start. 
Our immediate plan is to split our precinct into ${NUM_SUBDIV} smaller, more manageable communities,
and find one or two supporters in each area who are willing to take an active role in the 
upcoming election season.<br/><br/>

If you would like to help us organize this precinct further, 
come to one of our monthly meetings to suggest any positions or strategies 
for a 2018 victory, team up for at least one flyer distribution, 
or just meet fellow Democrats in our precinct, 
<b>please contact us at our precinct's email address: wakedems.04.06@gmail.com
or join our google group at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/wakedems-04-06</b>
<br/><br/>
Thanks for your time.
