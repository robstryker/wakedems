My name is Rob Stryker, and I am a volunteer with the Wake County Democrat party, 
working with precinct ${PRECINCT}. We have identified your home as a strong 
democratic household based on the party registration and voting records of the 
residents registered to vote at this address. <br/>

${RESIDENTS}

Our immediate goal is to split our precinct into ${NUM_SUBDIV} smaller, more manageable communities,
and find one or two supporters in each area who are willing to take an active role in the 
upcoming election season. <br/><br/>

If you would like to help us organize this precinct further with activities such as 
canvassing, phone-banking, or voter registration drives, or if you would like 
to come to one of our monthly meetings to express your opinions on any positions 
or strategies you'd like to see our precinct, or the Wake County party, take throughout
the upcoming election season, please contact James Wolf at james.s.wolf2815@gmail.com
<br/><br/>
Thanks for your time. 
<br/>
 - Rob Stryker
